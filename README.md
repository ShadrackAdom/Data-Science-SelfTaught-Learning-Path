# Data-Science-SelfTaught-Learning-Path

This repository serves as a log of my self-taught data science journey. It contains a collection of notebooks and code snippets that is compiled from numerous online courses, tutorials, 
and books to deepen my understanding of data science concepts. The ultimate objective of this repository is to provide a reference for anyone interested in learning data science. 
My journey is greatly influenced by the Open Source Society University (OSSU), which offers a comprehensive guide to learning computer science and data science through open-source resources. 
As I follow the OSSU curriculum and explore additional resources, I will continue to update this repository with my progress and newfound knowledge.
